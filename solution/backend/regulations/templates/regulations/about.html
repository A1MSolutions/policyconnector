                    <strong>Policy Connector</strong> organizes together policy materials from U.S. government websites to make it easier to do policy research. You can use it to:</p>
                    <ul>
    	                <li>Find materials <strong>related to a regulation</strong>, including statutes, executive orders, memos, and agency handbooks: <em><a href="/5/351/Subpart-H/2017-01-01/#351-801">5 CFR 351.801</a></em>.</li>
    	                <li>Find materials <strong>related to an executive order or memo</strong>, such as regulations, agency guidance, and court cases: <em><a href="/subjects?subjects=4">Return to In-Person Work</a></em>.</li>
    	                <li>Search across all policy materials: <em><a href="/search?q=probationary+period">probationary period</a></em>.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>How this site is updated</h2>
				
				<h3>Curated links to resources</h3>
                <p>To incorporate executive orders, memos, guidance, agency publications, and other kinds of resources, we add links to the database by hand and annotate them with related regulations and executive actions. We make an effort to keep this site up to date, but we cannot promise a specific cadence of updates.</p>
				<h3>Free public government APIs</h3>
				<p>
					This tool displays regulation text from <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eCFR</a>. When new rules become effective, the Office of the Federal Register incorporates them into eCFR <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/reader-aids/understanding-the-ecfr/how-is-the-ecfr-updated" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">within two business days</a>. This tool syncs with eCFR once a day using the <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/reader-aids/ecfr-developer-resources/rest-api-interactive-documentation" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eCFR API</a>. So, it can take up to three business days for changes to be incorporated into this tool.
				</p>
				<p>
					Links to new rules are pulled automatically from the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Office of the Federal Register</a> once a day, using the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/developers/documentation/api/v1" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal Register API</a>.
				</p>
				<p>This tool uses the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link-docs/" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GovInfo link API</a> to provide links to past versions of regulations.</p>
